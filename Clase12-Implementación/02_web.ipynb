    "In this part, we will extend the image API developed in Part 13.1 to work with a web application.  This technique allows you to use a simple website to upload/predict images, such as Figure 13.WEB.\n",

    "To do this, we will use the same API developed in Module 13.1.  However, we will now add a [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) website around it. This application is a single page web application that allows you to upload images for classification by the neural network.  If you would like to read more about ReactJS and image uploading, you can refer to the [blog post](http://www.hartzis.me/react-image-upload/) that provided some inspiration for this example.  I added neural network functionality to a simple ReactJS image upload and preview example.\n",
